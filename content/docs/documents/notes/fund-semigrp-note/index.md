This document serves as lecture notes for my teaching, witch consists of the reorganization and rearrangement of the key concepts from Chapters 1–4 of the masterpiece of John M Howie, the _Fundamentals of Semigroup Theory_. I think the notations used in the original book are outdated, so I have adopted my own preferred notations. In certain sections, such as the section of Varieties, I have incorporated some elements of category theory to achieve a broader perspective.
