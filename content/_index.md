<!--
此网站包含以下内容:
1. 笔记，比如论文阅读笔记，补充的某些教材的证明，等等。由于追求记录速度，不会过多注意文章格式。通常会以pdf格式发布。见左侧Note条目。
2. 教程，自己学习总结而得的系统性的教程。相比笔记格式更加规范，同样会以pdf格式发布。见左侧Tutorials条目。
2. 一些杂文, 包括评论, 故事等. 见左侧Blog条目.-->

1. Notes, such as reading notes on papers, complete proofs for certain textbooks, etc. Due to the pursuit of recording speed, not much attention will be paid on the article format. They are usually published in PDF format. See the __Notes__ section on the left side.
